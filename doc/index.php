Hi, I am Chinghoih Lancaster.  
I moved to England from India in 2007 and now live in Chorlton with my husband.  
I have a large, extended family and have always been surrounded by children.  
In Bangalore, I brought up my niece and successfully ran a student hostel.  
I  have excellent English and also speak several Indian regional dialects as well as Hindi and Urdu.  
<br/>
<br/>
Nothing gives me greater pleasure than playing with children and helping them to grow in confidence, so, when I settled in England, I decided to train and get the relevant <a href="experience.php">experience</a> and <a href="qualifications.php">qualifications</a> to allow me to work as a childminder.  
<br/>
<br/>
I am registered with <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/CARE/EY432868">Ofsted</a>, having passed their childminding inspection. 
I am also a member of the <a href="http://www.pacey.org.uk/">Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years (PACEY)</a> &ndash; formerly National Childminding Association (NCMA) &ndash; and am covered by their public and private insurance. </p>
<p>Click <a href="vacancies.php" title="Childcare vacancies">here</a> for vacancies.<br/>
  <br/>
In my spare time, I go to the gym, visit local <a href="restaurants.php">Indian regional restaurants</a> and  help people  North East Indian  to make and sell
 <a href="bags.php">bags</a> and <a href="crafts.php">cushions</a>.
